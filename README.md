# Example IoT Project - With Pimoroni enviro+

## Introduction

This repository holds an example script to display the sensor data from a Pimoroni enviro+ HAT. This is not a production ready script and only really here as a proof of concept.

## Requirements

You need the following things for this to work:

- Enviro+ Library - https://learn.pimoroni.com/article/getting-started-with-enviro-plus
-- run the install-bullseye.sh script

## Additional Information

The additional file `sensordata.service` can be used to enable the script as a service. If you want to use it, you have to change the path to the script.
